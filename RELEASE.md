# Release Log — The Big Shoebox Project (TBS-001)

Version history for the project. Each tagged [GitHub release](https://github.com/alvinr/tbs/releases)
has a dated section below summarizing what changed since the previous release. Versioning is
informal `MAJOR.MINOR` — this is a design + documentation repository, not shipped software.

## How releases work — the gate

Between releases, **jot every notable change under [Unreleased]** as it lands (one bullet per
change). That running list is the source we curate from. **Cutting a release is gated on this
file** — a release must not ship without a changelog entry:

1. Make sure **[Unreleased]** captures everything since the last tag.
2. Promote it: rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [X.Y] — YYYY-MM-DD` and start a fresh empty
   **[Unreleased]** above it.
3. Commit, tag, and create the GitHub release from that section's notes.

**`bash release.sh X.Y`** automates steps 2–3 (promote → commit → tag → `gh release create`) and
**refuses to proceed if [Unreleased] is empty**, which is what enforces the gate.

## [Unreleased]

- **Fix: 4 gallery diagrams were broken images on the site** — the film-plane corner-joint study
  diagrams (`film-joint-options`, `film-joint-study-gimbal`, `film-joint-study-ujoint`,
  `film-corner-gimbal`) were listed in `all-diagrams.md` but not registered in `publish.sh` /
  `setup_docs.py`, so their PNGs never synced to `published/assets/` (404 on the live gallery). Added
  them to both sync registries and re-published. (Shipped broken in 0.4 — the lint gallery-gate checks
  the markdown lists every PNG but not that each is wired for syncing.)

## [0.4] — 2026-07-20

- **Film Plane Redesign** - Major rebuild of how the film plane pivots around the four corners. A new 3d model was created **`film-plane-mechanism.skp`** and `film-plane.skp` was retired along with its generator. The design centers around a U-Joint on each corner along with 2 slides per corner for articulation. The U-joint funnels
  the whole corner into a **304 stainless corner plate**. Parts are SKU's all reconciled along with the budget estimate.

- **Light-trap door top/bottom seals → strip brush** — the two horizontal door-frame seals the
  swinging panel edge *sweeps across* were changed from a steel seal-lip + EPDM compression to a
  **nylon-filament strip brush**. The panel/drum-box top edge's deliberate ~30mm overlap is now recorded
  as intended bristle engagement, **not** a clash.

- **Film-plane muslin clamp: cam-lever → spring clip** — retired the cam-lever toggle for a spring
  clip: a fixed jaw bolted to the ALU frame upstand (countersunk bolts, nuts on the inside) + a
  spring-loaded jaw that pinches the muslin + a neoprene pad onto the ACM board, squeeze-to-open
  (torsion spring holds closed).

- **TBS-002 "Mini-TBS" classroom camera** — the proof-of-concept two-box cardboard pinhole
  camera was recast as an educational design (Part I teaching / Part II build) and refined
  throughout: the film plane became a cut-cardboard flap (no foam board), push-pin paper
  mounting, a pin-load-seal-coat-dry coating sequence done by feel in the sealed box (no
  safelight), a single wash tray, a re-centered pinhole, and — the key fix — print extraction
  through the boxes' **own top flaps** (built flaps-up) instead of a custom-cut wall. Added an
  interactive **Sketchfab 3D model** (ghosted boxes joined with grey tape; clickable shutter,
  film-plane panel, and top flaps) embedded in the doc, generated from a new
  `generate_mini_tbs_model.py` with geometry single-sourced from `mini_tbs_constants.py`.

- **Site footer + theme overrides** — the footer now reads inline as
  `© 2026 Alvin Richards — Released under GNU AGPLv3. Version v0.3` instead of dropping the bare
  `v0.3` onto its own right-justified line (which wrapped and read oddly), and the Material theme
  overrides moved from `overrides/` to **`src/overrides/`** (`custom_dir` updated in `mkdocs.yml` +
  `setup_docs.py`; the footer partial is `src/overrides/partials/copyright.html`).

## [0.3] — 2026-07-09

- **Fix: an arch-broken heavy dep no longer blocks commits** — the weight generator guarded optional
  numpy/matplotlib with `except ModuleNotFoundError`, which does NOT catch a wrong-arch/ABI `dlopen`
  failure (a *bare* `ImportError`), so an arm64 numpy under an x86_64 python crashed the `weight` lint
  gate and blocked check-in. Broadened the guards to `except ImportError` (degrade to the math path),
  added a `lint.py` check that flags the narrow pattern, and documented the rule (CLAUDE.md § Optional
  Heavy Dependencies).
- **2d label cleanup** - pass to clean up messy and unreadable labels on all 2d diagrams
- **IBC report — diagrams inline** — the IBC stacking report embedded its 8 construction sheets only in
  the §8 gallery; each sheet now also appears **inline next to the section it illustrates** (cross-section
  + frame elevations in §3, fastening details in §4, bulkhead ports in §6, internal plumbing in §7),
  matching the other reports. The §8 gallery stays on the site but is `brochure:skip`-ped so the PDF
  shows the inline set only (no double-embed).
- **Brochure reconciliation** — Reduced dead space in the document (e.g. heading spacing, diagram size), removed sections that were not required (e.g. operating manual), followed format style of github site, and general re-organization of the PDF content.
- **3D overview scene + label pass** — reworked the per-subsystem scenes so each reads cleanly: the
  Ventilation scene gains the Fan A/B power cables (own tag) routed back to the EP, drops the
  plumbing-panel pump wiring, and shows only the evap-cooler (Cct E) circuit at the external panel — the
  PV + E-stop runs split onto a new "EP Ext Wiring" tag, kept in the Electrical scene. Labeled-scene
  leaders fixed (Fan B exits the cargo-door end, the filter-skid leader lands on the filters) and the
  solar array is ghosted so the exterior labels read through it.
- **Spray-bar supply hose** — added the flexible coiled feed from BV-05 (90° elbow → coil) up to the
  raised spray-bar feed pole, in both the overview and water models.
- **Spray-bar carriage bolts** — the tray-facing clamp-bolt heads are now drawn **countersunk** (a flush
  frustum seated in the clamp underside, top nut still proud) in the 3D model, matching the 2D detail.
- **Walkway top-rail brackets** — restored the film-plane **top-rail wall-seat saddle brackets**
  (interior back-plate + exterior through-bolted plate, at both the near and far walls) that the walkway
  model had dropped; the bottom rail stays on the shared combined corner plate.
- **Electrical focus model** — dropped the ghost ceiling so the model orbits freely without it occluding
  the gear, and added the two fan-feed callouts (Cct-A → Fan A at the sealed end; Cct-B → Fan B wall box
  + flex jumper) to the Labeled scene.
- **Water model cleanup** — the pinhole-wall water model drops the external EP panel + evap cooler, adds
  the spray bar for context, removes the green PV / grey E-stop EP cables, and reconnects the purple
  Cct-C pump feed to the panel's own master switch.
- **Non-destructive Sketchfab metadata** — the in-model metadata stamp is now fill-only-if-blank, so a
  regenerate / re-send never overwrites a model's saved title, description, tags, or stable UID.

## [0.2] — 2026-07-07
- **Electrical Panel Redesign** — the EP was reorganized into a tall narrow **vertical column** (battery
  packs re-stacked vertically, gear above, PV array disconnect dropped to operator reach) to fit the one
  clear wall band between the pinhole, chem shelf, and transport-stay anchors; the layout is formalized
  into `tbs_constants`. The 5026 fuse block and the IP65
  enclosure was corrected to its real datasheet footprint. The overview's EP now **delegates to the electrical model's builders**, eliminating
  the hand-maintained duplicate that kept drifting. Cascaded to the 2D (battery drawn as the stacked pair;
  Sheet-5 panel layout redrawn as the full column) and the weight CG. The near-walkway 500mm **widened
  access band** was then re-worked around the EP + chem shelf. The **EP column relocated left**
  to fit inside it, and the **chem-shelf
  depth trimmed 300→225** for walk-around clearance (275mm past the shelf, 328mm behind the EP).
- **Reconcile part dimensions** - resolved a number of drifts from the actual part dimensions vs. what had been
  codified and drawn in 2d and 3d models. Some parts rectified were evap cooler, skate wheels, film plane pivot, saddle straps etc.
- **Drift-tooling hardening** — added `lint.py --verify-all`, a staging-independent full sweep that
  regenerates every model `.rb` and byte-compares it against the working tree, catching **committed-stale**
  outputs that the staged-diff missing-cascade check can miss; wired it into the `publish.sh` deploy gate.
  Promoted the release-only `check_unused_imports` to a per-commit `lint.py` advisory and cleaned the 14 imports
  the EP re-lay had orphaned.
- **Single-source facts audit** — registered 5 previously-unpoliced system constants as `facts.yml` facts
  (corridor width, container rib spacing, IBC stack height, widened near-walkway, clamp spacing), each a
  `constant:` reference with a tight, verified alias, so a future prose restatement of these now trips the
  drift gate; wrapped the corridor-width restatements in `plumbing-report §3.2` as auto-updating placeholders.
- **Distortion-render de-duplication** — `tilt-swing-board-analysis §4` re-embedded the same nine C0–C8
  combined renders that `distortion-renders §3` (the dedicated gallery) already owns; §4 now points to the
  gallery and keeps only its unique content — the projection model and per-configuration optical analysis
  (renamed "Combined Distortion Analysis").
- **Walkway grating corrected 15mm → 25mm** — the 15mm molded-FRP grate was a **bogus spec**: the thinnest
  molded FRP made is 1"/25mm. Corrected to 25mm; the extra 10mm is absorbed **upward**, verified against the full 56° hinge-panel swing arc (arc only crosses the removable lift-out decks + open tray). Cascaded: film-plane
  bottom rail `RAIL_OFF_BOT` 150→160
  (−10mm image, FP wall anchors move), battery + evap-stow +10mm, grate weight 11→12.7 kg/m²
