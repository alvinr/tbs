# Release Log — The Big Shoebox Project (TBS-001)

Version history for the project. Each tagged [GitHub release](https://github.com/alvinr/tbs/releases)
has a dated section below summarizing what changed since the previous release. Versioning is
informal `MAJOR.MINOR` — this is a design + documentation repository, not shipped software.

## How releases work — the gate

Between releases, **jot every notable change under [Unreleased]** as it lands (one bullet per
change). That running list is the source we curate from. **Cutting a release is gated on this
file** — a release must not ship without a changelog entry:

1. Make sure **[Unreleased]** captures everything since the last tag.
2. Promote it: rename `## [Unreleased]` → `## [X.Y] — YYYY-MM-DD` and start a fresh empty
   **[Unreleased]** above it.
3. Commit, tag, and create the GitHub release from that section's notes.

**`bash release.sh X.Y`** automates steps 2–3 (promote → commit → tag → `gh release create`) and
**refuses to proceed if [Unreleased] is empty**, which is what enforces the gate.
